General:
- const correctness in prefabs
    - const version for Property<T>::getMetadata()
    - parent parsing in json beforehand
- Logo
- dependency resolving upon remove
- type system (as built in the engine?)
- entity allocation
(- Log singleton does not allow polymorphism so far)
- BUG: 1.) Allocate Property p of type T with pool allocator.
       2.) T * ptr = &p.
       3.) Deallocate p.
       4.) allocate Properties of T until there is again a valid property at the memory chunk p was before
       5.) ptr now points again to a valid property but doesn't know that it is not the same property anymore.
       // This bug should be rare and only occur on undisciplined pointer use.
