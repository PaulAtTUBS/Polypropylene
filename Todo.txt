Before publish:
- Example with Manager and View (and Systems thereby?)
- better registration for json serialisers
- test on linux again

General:
- Logo
- refine error message on prefab loading when dependencies are not met
- dependency resolving upon remove
- type system as built-in the engine
- make ResourceLoaderT::loadToOrGetFromResources more intuitive
- entity allocation
(- Log singleton does not allow polymorphism so far)
